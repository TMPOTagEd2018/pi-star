                                <h2>Threat Algorithm</h2>
								<p>Each sensor was given a different weight value based on how much of a threat the action triggering the sensor would create. The values were distributed so that the total sum for all of the sensors would add up to 10, which is the maximum threat level. Each sensor has it's own threshold for detecting activity which determined whether or not it would be contributing to the overall threat score. Additionally, if the heartbeat of a certain node was not detected, meaning that an attacker had manually switched off the node, the sum of the threat weights of all the sensors in that node was added to the threat score. Finally, depending on the threat score, the user is notified of whether there was complete safety, potential activity, suspicious activity, or a critical threat. If the threat score reaches an index of 8 out of 10, the alarm and external encryption are triggered. </p>
								<p>In order to prevent the threat level from immediately decreasing after an action was completed, such as opening a door and closing it right after, the algorithm uses the magnitude of the difference in the last 10 values from a given sensor to determine the rate of decay of that sensor's contribution to the overall threat score.</p>
